Iris Data Research

The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.http://www.lac.inpe.br/~rafael.santos/Docs/CAP394/WholeStory-Iris.html

According to UCI Machine Learning Repository, the Iris dataset is widely used in pattern recognition learning. One class is linearly separable from the other two classes, which are not linearly separable from each other. The predicted attribute of the data set is the class of Iris plant to which each observation belongs.

The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset with a default machine learning task of classification. It consists of 150 instances with five attributes, with four of these being the measurements of the sepal and petals of each observation in the data set and the fifth being the class or species of Iris that each observation belongs to. It includes 50 plants each of three classes of Iris plant, where each class is a different type or species of Iris plant. The three classes in the data set are the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolor and the Iris Virginica. The data set was donated in 1988 by Michael Marshall but the data set was created by R.A. Fisher in 1936.https://www.angela1c.com/projects/iris_project/the-iris-dataset/

The Iris data set is a relatively small multi-variate data set containing of only 150 rows and 5 fields or variables in columns. Each observation in the Iris data set consists of a four dimensional array of numerical measurements and a single categorical class of iris species to which it belongs and represents one instance of an iris plant or flower.
